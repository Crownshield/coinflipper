# Toss Flip Simulator

## Introduction :eyes: 

As the name implies, the **Toss Flip Simulator** is a program made in C programming language that mimicks the flip of a fair coin. It takes as input, the number of times you desire to flip the coin, it then generates random results (Head or Tail), based on the number inputted.

## How It Works :rocket:

* The first input the program takes is the number of times you wish to flip the coin, it then produces a random result, telling you how many Heads and tails were generated
* You are then further prompted to input one of two options:\
    -'A' to flip again\
    -'X' to exit the Program
